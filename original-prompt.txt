We will create a .net core web application from scratch
Angular as front end, backend micro service

We won't have a real backend, this is for a demo so all our backend storage will be in-memory

Can you create a sample application - a shopping list application

* App should show look old - think 2005 web - we want to have as an excecise to smarten up the UI
* It should display a list of shopping lists (e.g. "Grocery list friday", "Weekend party", "School start clothes", ..)
* Selecting a shoppping-list should open the list and show the content
* It should be possible to add, edit and remove items (free text) in the list
* It should be possible to add or remove shopping lists
* It should not be possible to rename a shopping list (this will be an excercise later)
* There should be a button to reset the application, removing all changes done and showing the default lists.

Make a plan for how you would like to do this and let me check it
